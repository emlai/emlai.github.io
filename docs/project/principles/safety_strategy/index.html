the language or merely an implementation option. Application-specific logic
errors can be prevented by testing, but can lead to security vulnerabilities in
production. Safety categories will be referred to using names based on the type
of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)#Software_vulnerabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security vulnerability</a>
they protect against.</p><p>A key subset of safety categories Carbon should address are:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Memory safety</strong></a> protects
against invalid memory accesses. Carbon uses
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/spe.2105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two main subcategories</a>
for memory safety:</p><ul><li><p><em>Spatial</em> memory safety protects against accessing an address that&#x27;s out
of bounds for the source. This includes array boundaries, as well as
dereferencing invalid pointers such as uninitialized pointers, <code>NULL</code> in
C++, or manufactured pointer addresses.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em> memory safety protects against accessing an address that has
been deallocated. This includes use-after-free for heap and
use-after-return for stack addresses.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Type safety</strong></a> protects
against accessing valid memory with an incorrect type, also known as &quot;type
confusion&quot;.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Data_race" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Data race safety</strong></a>
protects against racing memory access: when a thread accesses (read or
write) a memory location concurrently with a different writing thread and
without synchronizing.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="safety-guarantees-versus-hardening">Safety guarantees versus hardening<a class="hash-link" href="#safety-guarantees-versus-hardening" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In providing safety, the underlying goal is to prevent attacks from turning a
<em>logic error</em> into a <em>security vulnerability</em>. The three ways of doing this can
be thought of in terms of how they prevent attacks:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Safety guarantees</strong> prevent bugs. They offer a strong requirement that a
particular security vulnerability cannot exist. Compile-time safety checks
are always a safety guarantee, but safety guarantees may also be done at
runtime. For example:</p><ul><li><p>At compile-time, range-based for loops offer a spatial safety guarantee
that out-of-bounds issues cannot exist in the absence of concurrent
modification of the sequence.</p></li><li><p>At runtime, garbage collected languages offer a temporal safety
guarantee because objects cannot be freed while they&#x27;re still
accessible.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Error detection</strong> checks for common logic errors at runtime. For example:</p><ul><li><p>An array lookup function might offer spatial memory error detection by
verifying that the passed index is in-bounds.</p></li><li><p>A program can implement reference counting to detect a temporal memory
error by checking whether any references remain when memory is freed.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Safety hardening</strong> mitigates bugs, typically by minimizing the feasibility
of an attack. For example:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Control Flow Integrity (CFI)</a>
monitors for behavior which can subvert the program&#x27;s control flow. In
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clang</a>, it is
optimized for use in release builds. Typically CFI analysis will only
detect a subset of attacks because it can&#x27;t track each possible code
path separately. It should still reduce the feasibility of both spatial
memory, temporal memory, and type attacks.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/slides/Serebryany-Stepanov-Tsyrklevich-Memory-Tagging-Slides-LLVM-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memory tagging</a>
makes each attempt at an invalid read or write operation have a high
probability of trapping, while still not detecting the underlying bug in
every case. Realistic attacks require many such operations, so memory
tagging may stop attacks in some environments. Alternatively, the trap
might be asynchronous, leaving only a tiny window of time prior to the
attack being detected and program terminated. These are probabilistic
hardening and reduces the feasibility of both spatial and temporal
memory attacks.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Under both error detection and safety hardening, even if a safety is protected,
the underlying bugs will still exist and will need to be fixed. For example,
program termination could be used for a denial-of-service attack.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="philosophy">Philosophy<a class="hash-link" href="#philosophy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Carbon&#x27;s
<a href="/docs/project/goals/#practical-safety-and-testing-mechanisms">practical safety and testing mechanisms</a>
will emphasize guaranteed safety where feasible without creating barriers to
Carbon&#x27;s <a href="/docs/project/goals/">other goals</a>, particularly performance and
interoperability. This limits Carbon&#x27;s options for guaranteed safety, and as a
result there will be more reliance upon error detection and safety hardening.
The language&#x27;s design should incentivize safe programming, although it will not
be required.</p><p>When writing code, Carbon developers should expect to receive safety without
needing to add safety annotations. Carbon will have optional safety annotations
for purposes such as optimizing safety checks or providing information that
improves coverage of safety checks.</p><p>Carbon will favor compile-time safety checks because catching issues early will
make applications more reliable. Runtime checks, either error detection or
safety hardening, will be enabled where safety cannot be proven at compile-time.</p><p>There will be three high-level use cases or directions that Carbon addresses
through different build modes that prioritize safety checks differently:</p><ul><li>A <a href="#debug">debug</a> oriented build mode that prioritizes detecting bugs and
reporting errors helpfully.</li><li>A <a href="#performance">performance</a> oriented build mode that skips any dynamic
safety checks to reduce overhead.</li><li>A <a href="#hardened">hardened</a> oriented build mode that prioritizes ensuring
sufficient safety to prevent security vulnerabilities, although it may not
allow detecting all of the bugs.</li></ul><p>These high level build modes may be tuned, either to select specific nuanced
approach for achieving the high level goal, or to configure orthogonal
constraints such as whether to prioritize binary size or execution speed.
However, there is a strong desire to avoid requiring more fundamental build
modes to achieve the necessary coverage of detecting bugs and shipping software.
These build modes are also not expected to be interchangeable or compatible with
each other within a single executable -- they must be a global selection.</p><p>Although expensive safety checks could be provided through additional build
modes, Carbon will favor safety checks that can be combined into these three
build modes rather than adding more.</p><p>Over time, safety should <a href="/docs/project/goals/#software-and-language-evolution">evolve</a>
using a hybrid compile-time and runtime safety approach to eventually provide a
similar level of safety to a language that puts more emphasis on guaranteed
safety, such as
<a href="#guaranteed-compile-time-memory-safety-using-borrow-checking">Rust</a>. However,
while Carbon may <em>encourage</em> developers to modify code in support of more
efficient safety checks, it will remain important to improve the safety of code
for developers who cannot invest into safety-specific code modifications.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="principles">Principles<a class="hash-link" href="#principles" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Safety must be
<a href="/docs/project/goals/#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write">easy to ramp-up with</a>,
even if it means new developers don&#x27;t receive the full safety that Carbon
can offer.</p><ul><li><p>Developers should benefit from Carbon&#x27;s safety without needing to learn
and apply Carbon-specific design patterns. Some safety should be enabled
by default, without safety-specific work, although some safety will
require work to opt in. Developers concerned with performance should
only need to disable safety in rare edge-cases.</p></li><li><p>Where there is a choice between safety approaches, the safe option
should be incentivized by making it equally easy or easier to use. If
there is a default, it should be the safe option. It should be
identifiable when the unsafe option is used. Incentives will prioritize,
in order:</p><ol><li>Guaranteed safety.</li><li>Error detection.</li><li>Safety hardening.</li><li>Unsafe and unmitigated code.</li></ol></li><li><p>Language design choices should favor more efficient implementations of
safety checks. They should also allow favor automation of testing and

retraining of C++ developers and easing migration of C++ codebases, over the
kind of provable safety that some other languages pursue, particularly Rust.</p><p>A key motivation of Carbon is to move C++ developers to a better, safer
language. However, if Carbon requires manually rewriting or redesigning C++ code
in order to maintain performance, it creates additional pressure on C++
developers to learn and spend time on safety. Safety will often not be the top
priority for developers; as a result, Carbon must be thoughtful about how and
when it forces developers to think about safety.</p><p>Relying on multiple build modes to provide safety should fit into normal
development workflows. Carbon can also have features to enable additional
safety, so long as developers can start using Carbon in their applications
<em>without</em> learning new paradigms.</p><p>Where possible, safety checks shouldn&#x27;t require work on the part of Carbon
developers. A safety check that requires no code edits or can be handled by
automated migration may be opt-out, as there is negligible cost to developers.
One which requires local code changes should be opt-in because costs will scale
with codebase size. Safety check approaches which would require substantial
redesign by developers will be disfavored based on adoption cost, even if the
alternative is a less-comprehensive approach.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-build-modes-to-manage-safety-checks">Using build modes to manage safety checks<a class="hash-link" href="#using-build-modes-to-manage-safety-checks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Carbon will likely start in a state where most safety checks are done at
runtime. However, runtime detection of safety violations remains expensive. In
order to make as many safety checks as possible available to developers, Carbon
will adopt a strategy based on three build modes that target key use-cases.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="debug">Debug<a class="hash-link" href="#debug" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The debug build mode targets developers who are iterating on code and running
tests. It will emphasize detection and debuggability, especially for safety
issues.</p><p>It needs to perform well enough to be run frequently by developers, but will
make performance sacrifices to catch more safety issues. This mode should have
runtime checks for the most common safety issues, but it can make trade-offs
that improve performance in exchange for less frequent, but still reliable,
detection. Developers should do most of their testing in this build mode.</p><p>The debug build mode will place a premium on the debuggability of safety
violations. Where safety checks rely on hardening instead of guaranteed safety,
violations should be detected with a high probability per single occurrence of
the bug. Detected bugs will be accompanied by a detailed diagnostic report to
ease classification and root cause identification.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="performance">Performance<a class="hash-link" href="#performance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The performance build mode targets the typical application that wants high
performance from Carbon code, where performance considers processing time,
memory, and disk space. Trade-offs will be made that maximize the performance.</p><p>Only safety techniques that don&#x27;t measurably impact application hot path
performance will be enabled by default. This is a very high bar, but is crucial
for meeting Carbon&#x27;s performance goals, as well as allowing migration of
existing C++ systems which may not have been designed with Carbon&#x27;s safety
semantics in mind.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hardened">Hardened<a class="hash-link" href="#hardened" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The hardened build mode targets applications where developers want strong safety
against attacks in exchange for worse performance. It will work to prevent
attacks in ways that
<a href="#probabilistic-techniques-likely-cannot-stop-attacks">attackers cannot work around</a>,
even if it means using techniques that create significant performance costs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="managing-bugs-without-compile-time-safety">Managing bugs without compile-time safety<a class="hash-link" href="#managing-bugs-without-compile-time-safety" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Carbon&#x27;s reliance on runtime checks will allow developers to manage their
security risk. Developers will still need to reliably find and fix the
inevitable bugs, including both safety violations and regular business logic
bugs. The cornerstone of managing bugs will be strong testing methodologies,
with built-in support from Carbon.</p><p>Strong testing is more than good test coverage. It means a combination of:</p><ul><li><p>Ensuring unsafe or risky operations and interfaces can easily be recognized
by developers.</p></li><li><p>Using static analysis tools to detect common bugs, and ensuring they&#x27;re
integrated into build and code review workflows. These could be viewed as
static testing of code.</p></li><li><p>Writing good test coverage, including unit, integration, and system tests.</p></li><li><p>Implementing coverage-directed fuzz testing to discover bugs outside of
manually authored test coverage, especially for interfaces handling
untrusted data. Fuzz testing is a robust way to catch bugs when APIs may be
used in ways developers don&#x27;t consider.</p></li><li><p>Running continuous integration, including automatic and continuous running
of these tests. The checked development build mode should be validated, as
well as any additional build modes necessary to cover different forms of
behavior checking.</p></li><li><p>Easing automated testing and fuzzing through language features. For example,
if the language encourages value types and pure functions of some sort, they
can be automatically fuzzed.</p></li></ul><p>These practices are necessary for reliable, large-scale software engineering.
Maintaining correctness of business logic over time requires continuous and
thorough testing. Without it, such software systems cannot be changed and
evolved over time reliably. Carbon will re-use these practices in conjunction
with checking build modes to mitigate the limitations of Carbon&#x27;s safety
guarantees without imposing overhead on production systems.</p><p>When a developer chooses to use Carbon, adhering to this kind of testing
methodology is essential for maintaining safety. As a consequence, Carbon&#x27;s
ecosystem, including the language, tools, and libraries, will need to directly
work to remove barriers and encourage the development of these methodologies.</p><p>The reliance on testing may make Carbon a poor choice in some environments; in
environments where such testing rigor is infeasible, a language with a greater
degree of static checking may be better suited.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="caveats">Caveats<a class="hash-link" href="#caveats" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="probabilistic-techniques-likely-cannot-stop-attacks">Probabilistic techniques likely cannot stop attacks<a class="hash-link" href="#probabilistic-techniques-likely-cannot-stop-attacks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It&#x27;s expected that probabilistic techniques that can be applied at the language
level are attackable through a variety of techniques:</p><ul><li>The attacker might be able to attack repeatedly until it gets through.</li><li>The attacker may be able to determine when the attack would be detected and
only run the attack when it would not be.</li><li>The attacker might be able control the test condition to make detection much
less likely or avoid detection completely. For example, if detection is
based on the last 4 bits of a memory address, an attacker may be able to
generate memory allocations, viewing the address and only attacking when
there&#x27;s a collision.</li></ul><p>Hardware vulnerabilities may make these attacks easier than they might otherwise
appear. Future hardware vulnerabilities are difficult to predict.</p><p>Note this statement focuses on what can be applied to the language level. Using
a secure hash algorithm, such as SHA256, may be used to offer probabilistic
defense in other situations. However, the overhead of a secure hash algorithm&#x27;s
calculation is significant in the context of most things that Carbon may do at
the language level.</p><p>Combining these issues, although it may seem like a probabilistic safety check
could be proven to reliably detect attackers, it&#x27;s likely infeasible to do so.
For the various build modes, this means:</p><ul><li>The debug build mode will not typically be accessible to attackers, so where
a probabilistic technique provides a better developer experience, it will be
preferred.</li><li>The performance build mode will often avoid safety checks in order to reach
peak performance. As a consequence, even the weak protection of a
probabilistic safety check may be used in order to provide <em>some</em>
protection.</li><li>The hardened build mode will prefer non-probabilistic techniques that
<em>cannot</em> be attacked.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered<a class="hash-link" href="#alternatives-considered" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guaranteed-memory-safety-programming-models">Guaranteed memory safety programming models<a class="hash-link" href="#guaranteed-memory-safety-programming-models" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Multiple approaches that would offer guaranteed memory safety have been

<a href="/docs/project/goals/#fast-and-scalable-development">compiler performance goals</a>.
Rust compilation performance suggests its borrow checking performance is
slow, although it&#x27;s difficult to determine how significant this is or
whether it could be improved.<ul><li>The Rust compiler
<a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/rust-compilation-model-calamity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is slow</a>,
although
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/09/08/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-one-last-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">much has been done to improve it</a>.</li><li>Details of type checking, particularly requiring parsing of function
bodies to type check signatures, as well as wide use of
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monomorphization</a>
are likely significant contributors to Rust compilation performance.</li><li>LLVM codegen is also a significant cost for Rust compilation
performance.</li><li>With
<a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/languages/rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuchsia</a> as
an example, in December 2020, borrow checking and type checking combined
account for around 10% of Rust compile CPU time, or 25% of end-to-end
compile time. The current cost of borrow checking is obscured both
because of the combination with type checking, and because Fuchsia
disables some compiler parallelization due to build system
incompatibility.</li></ul></li><li>The complexity of using Rust&#x27;s compile-time safety may incentivize
unnecessary runtime checking of safety properties. For example, using
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>RefCell</code></a> or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Rc</code></a> to avoid changing
designs to fit compile-time safety models.</li><li>Some of the most essential safety tools that ease the ergonomic burden of
the Rust-style lifetime model (<code>Rc</code>) introduce <em>semantic</em> differences that
cannot then be eliminated in a context where performance is the dominant
priority.</li></ul><p>It&#x27;s possible to modify the Rust model several ways in order to reduce the
burden on C++ developers:</p><ul><li>Don&#x27;t offer safety guarantees for data races, eliminating <code>RefCell</code>.<ul><li>This would likely not avoid the need for <code>Rc</code> or <code>Arc</code>, and wouldn&#x27;t
substantially reduce the complexity.</li></ul></li><li>Require manual destruction of <code>Rc</code>, allowing safety checks to be disabled in
the performance build mode to eliminate overhead.<ul><li>This still requires redesigning C++ code to take advantage of <code>Rc</code>.</li><li>The possibility of incorrect manual destruction means that the safety
issue is being turned into a bug, which means it is hardening and no
longer a safety guarantee.</li><li>Carbon can provide equivalent hardening through techniques such as
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tmj32/papers/docs/ainsworth20-sp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MarkUs</a>,
which does not require redesigning C++ code.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall, Carbon is making a compromise around safety in order to give a path for
C++ to evolve. C++ developers must be comfortable migrating their codebases, and
able to do so in a largely automated manner. In order to achieve automated
migration, Carbon cannot require fundamental redesigns of migrated C++ code.
While a migration tool could in theory mark all migrated code as <code>unsafe</code>,
Carbon should use a safety strategy that degrades gracefully and offers
improvements for C++ code, whether migrated or not.</p><p>That does not mean Carbon will never adopt guaranteed safety by default, only
that performance and migration of C++ code takes priority, and any design will
need to be considered in the context of other goals. It should still be possible
to adopt guaranteed safety later, although it will require identifying a
migration path.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guaranteed-run-time-memory-safety-using-reference-counting">Guaranteed run-time memory safety using reference counting<a class="hash-link" href="#guaranteed-run-time-memory-safety-using-reference-counting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reference counting</a> is a

describing similar.</p><ul><li>&quot;Development&quot; was also considered, but this term is less specific and
would be better for describing all non-release builds together. For

measures that will be taken, and is a well-known term in the safety space.

terms try to balance the utility of well-known terminology with the succinctness
of a short phrase for build modes, and that limits the expressivity. Some
confusion is expected, and documentation as well as real-world experience (for

respect to detection rates. For example, a particular vulnerability such as heap

100% accuracy at 50% performance cost. At present, build modes should be
expected to evaluate such a scenario as:</p><ul><li>The debug build mode would choose the 99% accurate approach.<ul><li>Detecting safety issues is valuable for debugging.</li><li>The probabilistic detection rate won&#x27;t meaningfully affect accuracy of

feature.</p></li></ul><p>An example of why another build mode may be needed is
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThreadSanitizer</a>, which is
noted as having 5-15x slowdown and 5-10x memory overhead. This is infeasible for
normal use, but could be useful for some users in a separate build mode. A
trade-off that&#x27;s possible for Carbon is instead using an approach similar to
<a href="https://github.com/google/ktsan/wiki/KCSAN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCSAN</a> which offers relatively
inexpensive but lower-probability race detection.</p><p>Although options to these build modes may be supported to customize deployments,
the preference is to focus on a small set and make them behave well. For
example, if a separate build mode is added for ThreadSanitizer, it should be
considered a temporary solution until it can be merged into the debug build
mode.</p><p>Advantages:</p><ul><li>Grants more flexibility for using build modes as a solution to problems.<ul><li>With safety checks, this would allow providing safety checks that are
high overhead but also high detection rate as separate build modes.</li><li>With other systems, there could be non-safety performance versus
behavior trade-offs.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Disadvantages:</p><ul><li>Having standard modes simplifies validation of interactions between various
safety checks.<ul><li>Safety is the only reason that&#x27;s been considered for adding build modes.</li></ul></li><li>As more build modes are added, the chance of developers being confused and
choosing the wrong build mode for their application increases.</li></ul><p>Any long-term additions to the set of build modes will need to update this
principle, raising the visibility and requiring more consideration of such an
addition. If build modes are added for non-safety-related reasons, this may lead

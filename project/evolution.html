heading">​</a></h2><p>Carbon&#x27;s evolution process uses <a href="#proposals">proposals</a> to evaluate and approve
<a href="#when-to-write-a-proposal">significant changes</a> to the project or language.
This process is designed to:</p><ul><li>Ensure these kinds of changes can receive feedback from the entire
community.</li><li>Resolve questions and decide direction efficiently.</li><li>Create a clear log of rationale for why the project and language have
evolved in particular directions.</li></ul><p>When there are questions, concerns, or issues with a proposal that need to be
resolved, Carbon uses its <a href="#governance-structure">governance</a> system of
<a href="#carbon-leads-1">Carbon leads</a> to decide how to move forward. Leads are
fundamentally responsible for encouraging Carbon&#x27;s ongoing and healthy evolution
and so also take on the critical steps of the evolution process for proposals.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proposals">Proposals<a class="hash-link" href="#proposals" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>These are primarily structured as GitHub pull requests that use a somewhat more
formal document structure and process to ensure changes to the project or
language are well explained, justified, and reviewed by the community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="life-of-a-proposal">Life of a proposal<a class="hash-link" href="#life-of-a-proposal" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>Proposals consist of a PR (pull request) in GitHub that adds a document to

<a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/proposals/scripts/template.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the template</a>.</p></li><li><p>Proposal PRs start out in draft mode. When proposal PRs are ready, click on

<a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/projects/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposals project column</a>

they are generally interested and supportive of the high level direction
based on title and summary. Similarly, other reactions are encouraged to
help surface contributor&#x27;s sentiment.</p></li><li><p>We use GitHub issues to discuss and track <em>blocking issues</em> with proposals,
such as open questions or alternative approaches that may need further
consideration. These are assigned to carbon-leads to decide.</p></li><li><p>A <a href="#carbon-leads-1">Carbon lead</a> will be assigned to a proposal PR. They are
responsible for the basic review (or delegating that) as well as ultimately
approving the PR.</p></li><li><p>The assigned lead should ensure that there is a reasonable degree of
consensus among the contributors outside of the identified blocking issues.
Contributors should have a reasonable chance to raise concerns, and where
needed they should become blocking issues. Community consensus isn&#x27;t
intended to be perfect though, and is ultimately a judgement call by the
lead. When things are missed or mistakes are made here, we should just
revert or fix-forward as usual.</p></li><li><p>Once a reasonable degree of community consensus is reached and the assigned
lead finishes code review, the lead should
<a href="/project/code_review#approving-the-change">approve</a> the PR. Any
outstanding high-level concerns should be handled with blocking issues.</p></li><li><p>Optionally, the assigned lead can file a blocking issue for a one week final
comment period when they approve. This is rarely needed, and only when it is
both useful and important for the proposal to give extra time for community
comments.</p></li><li><p>The leads are responsible for resolving any blocking issues for a proposal
PR, including the one week comment period where resolving it indicates
comments arrived which require the proposal to undergo further review.</p></li><li><p>The proposal PR can be merged once the assigned lead approves, all blocking
issues have been decided, and any related decisions are incorporated.</p></li><li><p>If the leads choose to defer or reject the proposal, the reviewing lead
should explain why and close the PR.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proposal-roles">Proposal roles<a class="hash-link" href="#proposal-roles" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It is also useful to see what the process looks like for different roles within

writing a proposal. A team can always ask for a change to be made directly if
they believe it doesn&#x27;t need review. Conversely, a reviewer might also ask that
a pull request instead go through the full evolution process.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proposal-prs">Proposal PRs<a class="hash-link" href="#proposal-prs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A proposal PR should use the <code>proposal</code> label, have a descriptive title, and
easily understood initial summary comment. Authors and leads are encouraged to
edit both as necessary to ensure they give the best high-level understanding of
the proposal possible.</p><p>A proposal PR will include a &quot;P-numbered&quot; <em>proposal document</em>,
<code>proposals/pNNNN.md</code>, where <code>NNNN</code> is the pull request number. This file should
be based on the <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/proposals/scripts/template.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposal template file</a>.</p><p>When writing a proposal, try to keep it brief and focused to maximize the
community&#x27;s engagement in it. Beyond the above structure, try to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inverted Pyramid</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLUF</a> writing style to

adopt the proposal. Any information that feeds into making that decision, and
that should not be maintained as part of our living design documentation,
belongs in the proposal document. This includes background material to introduce
the problem, comparisons to any alternative designs that were considered and any
other current proposals in the same area, records of informal polls taken to
determine community preferences, and rationale for the decision based on the
project&#x27;s goals.</p><p>The proposal PR can contain related changes to the Carbon project, such as
updates to the design documentation. Those changes form part of the proposal,
and need not be additionally described in the proposal document beyond a mention
in the &quot;Proposal&quot; section that such changes exist. For example:</p><div class="language-md codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-md codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token title important punctuation" style="color:#393A34">##</span><span class="token title important"> Proposal</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">See the proposed changes to the design documents.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Readers of proposals are expected to consult the PR or the git commit that
merged the PR in order to understand the proposed changes.</p><p>The author of a proposal is not required to include changes to the design
documentation as part of a proposal, and it may in some cases be preferable to
decouple the proposal process from updating the design. When accepted, the
proposal would then be implemented through a series of future PRs to the rest of
the project, and the proposal document should describe what is being proposed in
enough detail to validate that those future PRs properly implement the proposed
direction.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-questions">Open questions<a class="hash-link" href="#open-questions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Feel free to factor out open questions in a proposal to issues that you assign
to the leads to resolve. You can even do this before sending the proposal for
review. Even after it&#x27;s resolved, an open question issue can be reopened if new
information comes up during the RFC.</p><p>When opening issues, add them to the
<a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Issues for leads&quot; project</a>
under &quot;Questions&quot;. Carbon leads use this to locate and prioritize the issue for
resolution.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="review-and-rfc-on-proposal-prs">Review and RFC on proposal PRs<a class="hash-link" href="#review-and-rfc-on-proposal-prs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When a proposal PR is assigned to the
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/carbon-leads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">carbon-leads GitHub group</a>,
one of them will be assigned the PR. They are responsible for helping land that
proposal, or explaining why the project won&#x27;t move forward in that direction.
The assigned lead is also ultimately responsible for the code review on the PR.
Proposals sent for review are also sent as an RFC to the entire community.</p><p>All active Carbon contributors are strongly encouraged to regularly skim the
title and summary comment of proposals under RFC that are interesting to them.
They should use GitHub reactions, including at least a thumbs-up, to show their
interest and enthusiasm about the proposal, and help encourage the author.
Writing proposals is <em>extremely hard work</em>, and we need to clearly show both
interest in the proposed direction of Carbon and appreciation for the work put
into the proposal. This is not about <em>approving</em> the proposal, or any of its
details. It is completely fine and coherent to both give a thumbs-up to a
proposal <em>and</em> provide a serious, blocking issue that needs to be resolved.</p><p><em>Anyone</em> in the community is welcome to participate in the RFC in detail if
interested. However, not everyone needs to participate in every RFC. If a
proposal is already getting actively and thoroughly reviewed, feel free to focus
your time on other proposals with fewer commenters. Even if there are issues or
problems discovered later, we can always fix them with follow-up proposals.</p><p>Both code review and high-level design comments are welcome. If an open question
comes up or a high-level blocking issue is uncovered, feel free to move it to
its own GitHub issue and assign it to the leads to resolve. That issue is also a
good place to focus discussion on that specific topic rather than the main PR.</p><p>The assigned lead should approve proposals once the following criteria are met:</p><ul><li><p>It looks good from a code review perspective.</p></li><li><p>At least three thumbs-up reactions showing general community interest.</p></li><li><p>The community has had a sufficient opportunity to review the proposed
change, given its scope and complexity.</p></li><li><p>Any remaining blocking issues are reasonably likely to resolve in a way that
allows the proposal to move forward. It is fine if some are not fully
decided, but a lead shouldn&#x27;t approve a proposal that&#x27;s unlikely to move
forward.</p></li></ul><p>The last two criteria are fundamentally judgement calls for the lead to make,
and we don&#x27;t try to formulate a rigid or fixed bar for them. If resolving the
blocking issues requires significant changes, the author should also get a fresh
approval from the assigned lead after those changes, just like they would with
code review.</p><p>The assigned lead may also request a final comment period for the community when
approving. This signals to the community that the proposal is likely to be
merged once the blocking issues are resolved, and any remaining concerns need to
be surfaced. The goal is to help uncover concerns that were hidden until it was
clear that the proposal is likely to move forward. However, requesting a final
comment period is not the default; the assigned lead should only do this when
there is some reason to expect further community comment is especially important
to solicit. Common cases to consider are contentious, complex, or dramatic
changes to the language or project. Ultimately, whether this is important is a
judgement call for the lead. This will be modeled by filing a blocking issue
that resolves in one week when approving. This issue will also explain the
motivation for requesting a final comment period.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blocking-issues">Blocking issues<a class="hash-link" href="#blocking-issues" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We use blocking GitHub issues to track open questions or other discussions that
the leads are asked to resolve. Any time a blocking issue is filed, that issue
forms both the primary discussion thread and where the leads signal how it is
resolved. We use issues both to track that there is a specific resolution
expected and that there may be dependencies.</p><p>We add blocking issues to the
<a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Issues for leads&quot; project</a>
under &quot;Blocking issues&quot;. Carbon leads use this to locate and prioritize the
issue for resolution.</p><p>These issues can be created at any time and by any one. Issues can be created
while the proposal is being drafted in order to help inform specific content
that should go into the proposal. It is even fine to create an issue first, even
before a proposal exists, as an open question about whether to produce a
particular proposal, or what a proposal that is being planned should say. For
issues which don&#x27;t (yet) have a specific proposal PR associated with them, at
some point the leads may ask that a proposal be created to help collect in a
more cohesive place a written overview of the issue and related information, but
this process need not be strictly or rigidly bound to having proposal text.</p><p>Avoid using issues for things that are just requests or suggestions on a
proposal PR. If in doubt, start off with a simple comment on the PR and see if
there is any disagreement -- everyone may already be aligned and agree. When a
comment does seem worth turning into an issue, don&#x27;t worry about that as the
author or the commenter. Getting the leads to resolve disagreement isn&#x27;t a bad
thing for anyone involved. This should be seen as a friendly way to move the
discussion out to its own forum where it&#x27;ll get resolved, and focus the PR on
improving the proposal and getting it ready to merge.</p><p>When an issue is created from a discussion on a PR, and after the discussion on
the <em>issue</em> all the original parties come to a happy agreement, it&#x27;s totally OK
to close the issue and move back to the code review in the PR. Anyone who would
prefer the leads to still chime in can re-open the issue and the leads will
follow up, even if it&#x27;s only to get confirmation that everyone <em>did</em> end up
happy with the resolution. At the end of the day, while it&#x27;s fine to resolve an
issue that <em>everyone</em> actually ended up agreeing about (maybe once some
confusion is addressed), ultimately the leads are responsible for resolving
these issues and there is no pressure on anyone else to do so.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discussion-on-blocking-issues">Discussion on blocking issues<a class="hash-link" href="#discussion-on-blocking-issues" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Discussion on these issues, especially contentious ones, should endeavor to
focus on surfacing information and highlighting the nature of the tradeoff
implied by the decisions available. This is in contrast to focusing on advocacy
or persuasion. The goal of the issues shouldn&#x27;t be to persuade or convince the
leads to make a specific decision, but to give the leads the information they
need to make the best decision for Carbon.</p><p>It&#x27;s fine that some people have a specific belief of which decision would be
best; however, framing their contributions to the discussion as surfacing the
information that underpins that belief will make the discussion more
constructive, welcoming, and effective. Overall, everyone should strive to focus
on data-based arguments to the extent they can, minimizing their use of appeals
to emotion or excessive rhetoric.</p><p>None of this should preclude gathering information like polls of opinion among
groups, or signaling agreement. Where community members stand and how many agree
with that stance on any issue <em>is</em> information, and useful to surface.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance-structure">Governance structure<a class="hash-link" href="#governance-structure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="carbon-leads-1">Carbon leads<a class="hash-link" href="#carbon-leads-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Carbon leads are responsible for reviewing proposals and

understanding its users, data, and the underlying goals of the language.
However, there will be times when those don&#x27;t provide a clear cut rationale for
any particular decision -- all of the options are fine/good and someone simply
needs to choose which color to paint the bikeshed. The goal of the painter role
is to have a simple way to quickly decide these points.</p><p>Leads and teams may defer a decision to the painter if there is a consensus that
it is merely a bikeshed in need of paint. They may also open an issue to revisit
the color with data and/or user studies of some kind. This allows progress to be
unblocked while also ensuring we return to issues later and attempt to find more
definite rationale.</p><p>The painter is a single person in order to keep decisions around taste or
